## Mentor Profile Management
---
The mentor profile management allows mentors and admins to manage information associated with their account, including but not limited to, preferred name, profile picture, expertise in subjects approved by CSSE, dietary preferences/restrictions, expected graduation date, and phone number. These changes are done by a mentor using the Edit Profile use case. 
A restriction applied to mentors is that any change–insertion, edit, or deletion–to a mentor’s profile picture or preferred name will need to be approved by an admin for the change to take effect. Admin is also able to access each mentor’s profile page to insert, edit, or delete mentor personal information with the Override Profile use case.

## Penalty Score Management
---
Mentors can be assigned point values based on negative or positive behavior through Occurrences or Direct Admin Editing. Tigers4Tigers automatically detect tardiness and absences, and assign default point values for these occurrences depending on the time they occur. The amount of points a mentor has accumulated is stored in the system, and is accessible to (and editable) by Admin through a Invoice Tracking method where any change to the points logs where it came from ie. Admin or Occurrences.. The Tigers4Tigers is also able identify actions that should take place based on the total points a mentor has accumulated. For example, after a mentor has earned a total of –5 points, the system indicates that the mentor should be issued a verbal warning and sends a notification to the mentor. The tardiness time intervals, default point values assigned to tardiness and absences, and action item thresholds are configurable by Admin through all four configurable options in Penalty Score Management.

## Occurrence Submission
---
Mentors can submit occurrences that take place during mentoring to report behavior (both positive and negative) to Admin, and can do so anonymously if they choose. Mentors will do this by submitting a form containing the occurrence type, description, subject, and date of the occurrence. Tigers4Tigers will record the occurrence submission date and who it was submitted by (or anonymous if designated), and assigns a default course of action to the occurrence. Admin is able to review submitted occurrences and add notes if desired. Admin can configure the types of occurrences, as well as the default points and course of action assigned by occurrence type. The absent Occurence is automatically activated by a late timer that activates if the mentor did not activate the mentoring past a certain time

## Admin Summary Screen
---
 Admin can acknowledge attendance and behavior occurrences via the admin summary screen (see sections “Penalty Score Management” and “Occurrence Submission,” above, for details on these occurrences.) This screen contains a list of occurrences, pending or closed, that can be filtered to show only attendance or behavior occurrences. From this list, Admin may review occurrences, see a detailed view of each occurrence, edit the occurrence type, add notes, override default point values, override assigned actions, and mark occurrences as closed. 
Admin is also able to view a summary of all mentor profile activity and points, which must be displayed as a table of mentor names, links to their profiles, profile changes to review, attendance points, behavior points, and total points. From this view, admins then can approve or deny profile picture or preferred name changes.

In this screen, admin may also configure the following.
1. Tardiness intervals (e.g., 0-5 minutes, 5-15 minutes, 15-30 minutes, etc.),
2. Default point values associated with each tardiness interval,
3. The types of occurrences that can be selected in the occurrence submission form,
4. The courses of action that can be assigned to an occurrence (e.g., verbal warning, written
warning, termination of rehiring process),
5. Default point values and course of action associated with each occurrence type,
6. Point thresholds for automatically assigning courses of action (e.g., after –5 points, indicate
verbal warning is needed).

## Notifications
---
Notifications allows mentors to be notified of different activities they are responsible for (e.g.,
sessions they are assigned to lead). Mentors also are able to configure what types of notifications they would like to receive, when they would like to receive them, and what method of delivery they prefer (email or text). This is done mostly automatically in the back end of the program.
