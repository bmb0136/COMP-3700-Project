## Mentor Profiles
Mentor Profiles allows the mentors to store personal information on their account such as  preferred name, profile picture, expertise in subjects approved by CSSE and expected graduation date. Mentors can edit Their profile using the Edit Profile use Case, and if mentors want to change the profiles preferred name or profile picture then through Request Special Profile Edit and an Admin approval will the preferred name or profile picture change go in effect.
Admins can freely edit mentors profiles using Override Profile, an Admin variant of Edit Profile. Admins can also Summarise Mentor Activity which shows what all the mentors are doing. Another action that Admins can do is Query Mentor Profiles to look in more detail about what the mentor has done or the Mentors Occurrences or Score.
Penalty Score Management
Penalty Score Management controls the tracking of Penalty Scores for Mentors and at What points do Actions occur. A use case for the Admin in the Configure Action Thresholds Which allows the Admin freely determine at what point values that certain actions occur ie. at -10 Points a mentor might get a warning notification sent and or a notification to an Admin. Update Mentor Point Total lets the Admin add or modify the point total for a mentor that is logged in the Penalty Score invoice. Admins can also Configure Tardy Intervals to change how late or absent a Mentor needs to be and the capability to change what points are assigned to a Tardy Occurrence with Configure Default Point Values.

## Occurrences
Occurrences are event that happened in the system that cause other actions to occur, and all of the types are configurable by Admin with Configure Occurrence Types. One such Occurrence that a mentor can call is Report Occurrence which gives the mentor a framework to report an event that happened during a mentoring session whether its good or bad.. Admins are heavily involved with Occurrences where they can Review Occurrences and choose to Close the Occurrence, or Admins can directly Edit any Occurrence. Another thing Admins can do is Configure the Default Actions for Occurrences.

## Sessions
Sessionsi is where the Mentor mentors Mentees. In here Mentors can Start the Session and depending on the time of start the system will auto Mark Mentor as Tardy and Report a Tardy Occurrence. If the Mentor does not ever start the session then the Absence Timer will Mark Mentor as Absent which reports an Absence Occurrence.
Admins can also Assign Sessions to Mentorts which will Notify the Mentor of the session.

## Notifications
Notifications are Handled by the system, and Notification settings for a Mentor like where to send and what are configurable with Configure Notifications Preferences.

## Admin Summary Screen
The Admin Summary Screen encompass most of the Previous sections and gives the admin a Framework that lets the admin manage most if not all events from one screen such as, acknowledge attendance and behavior occurrences,displays a list of occurrences, pending or closed, that can be filtered and from this can Review a specific Occurrence. And can manage as well as see Mentor profile information.
